Cadet Hub Clubs are different. Popular providers typically charge between £10 and £20 per session, with some specialist workshops costing even more. Their curriculums are often focused mainly on Scratch, moving very slowly and offering little progression into more advanced languages.",

Their curriculums are often focused mainly on Scratch, moving very slowly and offering little progression into more advanced languages. They also rely on specialist tutors, which makes them harder to scale and less accessible outside certain areas. By contrast, Cadet Hub Clubs cost just £5 per session and give children access not only in school but also at home through our powerful Cadet Hub platform. Our curriculum covers Scratch as a foundation but quickly moves into Python, HTML, JavaScript, robotics, and even AI — far beyond what most providers offer. Schools don’t need specialist staff; a supervising teacher is enough, as the Cadet Hub delivers the learning. Most importantly, our mission is affordability and inclusivity: making coding accessible to every child, not just those at premium or selective schools.

At Code Cadets, we are student-centred, allowing children to follow their own pathways organically. We believe this helps encourage each child and promote effective personal development.

After that, they can specialise in areas such as Scratch Developer , Python , JavaScript , or HTML/Web Developer . Additional badges include Data Scientist , Machine Learning (AI) , Game Developer , and the (popular with parents!) Maths Coder badge . Our robotics clubs offer Robotics and Robotic Engineer badges. Throughout the year, children can also participate in competitions, challenges and hackathons, with plenty of prizes to keep the excitement level high!

Python, HTML and JavaScript are introduced to children at a much younger age than ever before. A disruptive approach - we are challenging the status quo and breaking down coding barriers for primary aged children. Beyond Scratch to Text-Based, Complex Coding Languages Most children have a natural curiosity for coding, and for many, their motivation to code is intrinsic. At Code Cadets, we are student-centred, allowing children to follow their own pathways organically. We believe this helps encourage each child and promote effective personal development. An Organic Approach To Learning We love when we spot natural talent and are dedicated to creating a supportive and nurturing environment for its development. We promise to develop coding and/or robotics skills in every child regardless of natural talent or ability.",

After that, they can specialise in areas such as Scratch Developer , Python , JavaScript , or HTML/Web Developer . Additional badges include Data Scientist , Machine Learning (AI) , Game Developer , and the (popular with parents!) Maths Coder badge . Our robotics clubs offer Robotics and Robotic Engineer badges.

While we ask that you sign up for a specific course, we understand that children enjoy variety. Within reason, they can switch pathways during the session or week, allowing them to experience different courses. STRUCTURE OF THE DAY The camp runs Monday to Friday: 10 am to 3 pm. Book individual days or full week. Children will focus on their courses in the morning with a Game Jam or Hackathon at the beginning of the afternoon session. A free choice of more practical activity then follows. Choose from Lego Robotics, Data Science, Cryptography, Micro:bit, Secret Mission … and more!",

ACTIVE CODING A CODING CAMP WITH A DIFFERENCE While coding is at the heart of all that we do, we understand parental concerns about prolonged screen time. At Code Cadets camps we strike a balance by incorporating an active component throughout the day. Regular breaks from the computer involve organised outdoor activities like rounders, cricket, football, bat and ball and more. It’s a blend of learning and play that ensures your child’s time with us is educational, active, and most importantly, fun! Note: our camps are for children aged 8+.

Starting with the basics of frame-by-frame animation, children learn how to bring drawings to life with motion, expression, and timing. As they progress, they’ll explore intuitive digital tools to enhance their animations with effects, duplicated frames, and custom visuals. Moving into 3D environments, learners create scenes and stories using camera movement and simple interactivity. The course ends with an introduction to professional 3D modelling and animation techniques, blending creativity with coding to spark imagination and build real-world digital skills—all in a fun, flexible way.",

Schools - Code Cadets can increase your school role! In-School Workshops We love nothing more than an in-school workshop here at Code Cadets. These can be tailored to suit the age group and ability levels of pupils. Half-day, full-day and full week options are available. We find our themed challenges are very popular at our workshops. These challenges involve pupils completing a series of timed activities all revolving around a particular theme. For example, they might work for an Esports company needing promotion for a new competition, or they could be undercover agents on a secret mission. These challenges involve a series of short activities tailored to different age groups covering Scratch, HTML, Python, Cryptography, Data Science, Lego Robotics, and Micro:bit .",

These challenges involve a series of short activities tailored to different age groups covering Scratch, HTML, Python, Cryptography, Data Science, Lego Robotics, and Micro:bit . Children love the variety of short, timed activities, earning stars or points as they progress, culminating in the award of The Challenger Badge and certificate upon completion. We can of course, run workshops dedicated to specific environments and languages, eg Web Design , Game Design etc. We will always discuss workshop content with school representatives beforehand to agree on learning outcomes and the needs of the children.

When We Spot Talent - Getting to know each child individually takes time, and as we become familiar with their abilities, we can tailor activities to match their interests. If we identify natural talent or potential, we eagerly anticipate nurturing and guiding children toward progress. We will never force a child to do an activity they don't want to do - they will be encouraged, not pressurised.

Note, this is a flexible learning pathway, often young children are capable of completing activities aimed at much older children. Very Young Children – most coding and robotics clubs will only accept children aged 7+. Here at Code Cadets we are happy to have 5 and 6 year olds in the after-school environment on the understanding that activities with this age group are informal, mostly game-based and self-led, while our tutors are on hand to guide, encourage and support as needed. Children are encouraged to learn via investigation of age-appropriate problem-solving apps.

The Use of iPads/Tablets - At some schools we only have the option to use iPads/tablets with all or most pupils. Some children also attend clubs and camps with their own tablets. It is important to note that progress is very limited on a tablet. Some older pupils enjoy coding on their own iPads but these tend to have larger screen sizes and they have an attached keyboard. Younger children using iPads/tablets in the school, club or camp environment are more limited in terms of the coding activities which can be accessed and therefore progress is more limited. Behaviour - At Code Cadets, we treat each other with kindness and respect and children are expected to behave as they would during the school day. Any misbehaviour in schools will be communicated to the school’s senior management team and dealt with in line with the school’s Behaviour Management Policy.",

These skills are directly applicable to mathematics, particularly in areas like algebra, geometry, and even calculus. Research has shown that children who engage in programming demonstrate stronger abilities in these types of mathematical reasoning. Applying Mathematical Concepts: Coding regularly requires children to apply mathematical concepts like variables, equations, and functions. Programming languages often include working with coordinates, loops, and sequences, which are fundamental in understanding mathematical operations. For example, game development or robotics projects often involve spatial reasoning and measurements, which reinforce their maths skills. Enhanced Engagement with Numbers and Patterns: Coding activities engage children with numbers and patterns, essential for maths learning. When children use loops and algorithms, they frequently interact with numbers in a meaningful way.",
